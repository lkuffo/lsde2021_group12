          "House Intelligence memo released: What it says\\n\\r\\nThe House Intelligence Committee has released its controversial memo outlining alleged abuses of secret surveillance by the FBI and Justice Department in the Trump-Russia investigation. Here are some key points:\\n\\r\\n* The Steele dossier formed an essential part of the initial and all three renewal FISA applications against Carter Page.\\n\\n* Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought from the FISA Court without the Steele dossier information.\\n\\r\\n* The four FISA surveillance applications were signed by, in various combinations, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Sally Yates, Dana Boente, and Rod Rosenstein.\\n\\r\\n* The FBI authorized payments to Steele for work on the dossier. The FBI terminated its agreement with Steele in late October when it learned, by reading an article in Mother Jones, that Steele was talking to the media.\\n\\r\\n* The political origins of the Steele dossier were known to senior DOJ and FBI officials but excluded from the FISA applications.\\n\\r\\n* DOJ official Bruce Ohr met with Steele beginning in the summer of 2016 and relayed to DOJ information about Steele's bias. Steele told Ohr that he, Steele, was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected president and was passionate about him not becoming president.\\n\\r\\nThe FBI and Justice Department mounted a monthslong effort to keep the information outlined in the memo out of the House Intelligence Committee's hands. Only the threat of contempt charges and other forms of pressure forced the FBI and Justice to give up the material.\\n\\r\\nOnce Intelligence Committee leaders and staff compiled some of that information into the memo, the FBI and Justice Department, supported by Capitol Hill Democrats, mounted a ferocious campaign of opposition, saying release of the memo would endanger national security and the rule of law.\\n\\r\\nBut Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes never wavered in his determination to make the information available to the public. President Trump agreed, and, as required by House rules, gave his approval for release.\\n\\r\\nFinally, the memo released today does not represent the sum total of what House investigators have learned in their review of the FBI and Justice Department Trump-Russia investigation. That means the fight over the memo could be replayed in the future when the Intelligence Committee decides to release more information.",

          "FACT: Trump Bombed Syria for Child Abusers. The White Helmets tricked children with dates and cookies to be part their fake chemical attack video; and, thereafter, physical abused them and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon them during the filming of the fake video.\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=JPFaEG9vJT4",
          "https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/AP\\/status\\/985024597459390469 So...we warned Russia just like we did last year?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso Mattis says it is a limited strike with no plans for further action unless another \\\"attack\\\" happens? \\r\\n\\r\\nI guess that makes it...less bad?",
          "Part 2:\\n\\r\\nAlso asserted: \\\"We're rushing to war! Russia will go to war with the USA over Syria!\\\" No. Syria is a useful tool for Putin. But that is all Syria is, as far as Russia is concerned. Let me tell you a quick story: There was a man named Ho Chi Minh who went to Moscow & became a client of the USSR, just like Asad is a client of Russia. The Soviets gave Minh advice, training, & weapons so Minh could stage a Communist revolution in Vietnam; the Soviets set up their guy, Minh, so that the USSR could exercise influence in the region (and a warm-water port, to boot), just like Russia is exercising its influence in the Middle East through Asad in Syria. Now, you may not remember this, but for 17 years, we fought a shooting war & won (the North went to peace table, but just like in Iraq, Democrats threw away the military victory & withdrew precipitously) against Minh, who was the USSR's guy, just like Asad is Russia's guy today. This all happened during the height of the Cold War, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, even, during which we were on the brink of nuclear war with the USSR (some land-based U.S. silos had their launch keys inserted, we found out, years later). It's worth remembering that the USSR was much more powerful than is Russia today. But there we were in Vietnam, devastating Minh's forces, who were Soviet clients---and Minh was much-more tightly bound to the USSR than Asad is to Russia today---, and did we get into a shooting war with the USSR? No, we did not. After the earlier Tomahawk missile strike on the Syrian airbase, did we get into a shooting war with Russia? No. Nor shall we if we punish Syria with a similar Tomahawk attack, because Russia has no intention of going to war over a pawn like Syria, just like the USSR didn't launch its nukes when it lost its hopes of a warm-water port in its pawn, Vietnam.\\n\\r\\nIf we wanted to defeat Russia, we could do so much more safely & easily & quickly through our economic power than through military action. If the U.S. economy is comparable to a person, then this action here ( https:\\/\\/www.reuters.com\\/article\\/us-usa-russia-sanctions-economy\\/russia-in-the-doldrums-new-u-s-sanctions-to-weigh-on-recovery-idUSKBN1HG2IT ) would be like the U.S. economy flexing the tip of one finger. Look what we were able to do to Russia, the punishing effect caused by the sanctions against just 12 individual Russian billionaires close to Putin; flex two fingers, let alone the U.S. economy's full muscular might, & Russia would be brought to its knees instantly. Like DJT tweeted, I agree: It's far preferable to get along peaceably & co-exist in prosperity; my point is that we could crush them much more quickly though economic action than military action.\\n\\r\\nObama let Russia creep into Syria, after they'd been driven out of the Middle East for decades. Obama allowed Asad to acquire & keep chemical weapons. DJT inherited Obama's huge mess left in the Middle East, and now it rests on DJT's shoulders to clean it up---and yes, that claim is often made by Dems, about supposed-messes made by Republican presidents, but Dems' lying about GOP messes left doesn't negate the fact that Dems ALWAYS leave messes behind: \\\"Of what they accuse one, they in fact do.\\\"\\n\\r\\nSometimes grown-ups have to do things they don't like to do.",
          "The chemical gas attack was fake and I side with Russia on this. However, I don't think #Trump has done a complete 180 and betrayed us all. He tricked everyone last year.

          "The Weaponization of the EPA Is Over: An Exclusive Interview With Scott Pruitt\\n\\r\\nIn his first year as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt has already transformed the agency in many ways. He spoke exclusively to The Daily Signal before addressing attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference\\u2019s annual Reagan Dinner. An edited transcript of the interview is below.\\n\\r\\nRob Bluey: You gave a speech at CPAC last year where you were just at the beginning of your tenure at the Environmental Protection Agency, and you outlined some of the things that you wanted to do. Here we are a year later, you\\u2019ve repealed, taken back, 22 regulations at a savings at $1 billion, a significant contribution to the U.S. economy, as President Donald Trump talked about in his speech. What does that mean?\\n\\r\\nScott Pruitt: Busy year. And it was great to be at CPAC about two weeks after having been sworn in last year. And I talked last year about the future ain\\u2019t what it used to be, that Yogi Berra quote that I cited about the change that was gonna take place at the agency and I think we\\u2019ve been about that change the last year. Focusing on rule of law, restoring process and order, making sure that we engage in cooperative federalism as we engage in regulation.\\n\\r\\nBut the key to me is that weaponization of the agency that took place in the Obama administration, where the agency was used to pick winners and losers. Those days are over.\\n\\r\\nhttps:\\/\\/www.dailysignal.com\\/2018\\/02\\/25\\/weaponization-epa-exclusive-interview-scott-pruitt\\/",
